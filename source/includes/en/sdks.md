# SDK

## C\# 

The C# SDK makes easier to build chatbots with BLiP platform. It is based on [.NET Core](https://dot.net/core), which allows the creation of multiplatform chatbots.

You can check the SDK source code in [Github](https://github.com/takenet/blip-sdk-csharp/) and the documentation on our [Wiki](https://github.com/takenet/blip-sdk-csharp/wiki).

## Javascript

If you are a Javascript developer and want to create a chatbot with **BLiP**, you must use the BLiP Javascript SDK. It was developed to help sending and receiving of BLiP messages using Javascript for browsers or [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) through persistent WebSocket connections.
