#Introduction

Welcome to **BLiP**! Here, we'll introduce you to the platform's basics in order to help you build your own chatbot.

You can create your chatbot in three ways:

- Through a SDK (C# or JavaScript)
- Through webhooks (for any language)
- Through a template (without any code)

The main goal of this documentation is provide a overview of BLiP plataform and present a lot of samples. For each subject you'll find code samples on the right side. The samples are presented in C#, JavaScript or as a generic HTTP request that you can use in your favorite programming language.

In the left side menu, you will find a step-by-step guide for each big subject on BLiP.
